 Image Caption Generator using Pre-trained Model
=============================================

This repository contains the source code and materials for the YouTube tutorial titled "[Image Caption Generator using a pre-trained model From Hugging Face](https://youtu.be/jxsYGsR98oU?si=cJE4og0T4OYu5q-R)". The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to create engaging and descriptive image captions using a pre-trained model called "nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning" available on Hugging Face. Throughout the tutorial, we walkthrough setting up the environment, preparing data, running predictions, fine-tuning options, and discuss best practices.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed the following prerequisites prior to proceeding:

*   Python >= 3.6
*   pip
*   [Google Colab account](https://colab.research.google.com/) (optional but recommended)

### Installation

Clone this repository onto your local system and navigate to the root directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/image-caption-generator.git
cd image-caption-generator
```
Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Usage
-----

Refer to the Jupyter Notebook named "<project\_name>.ipynb>" located inside the 'notebooks/' folder for the full implementation guide. You may choose to run the notebook locally or utilizing a cloud service such as Google Colab.
